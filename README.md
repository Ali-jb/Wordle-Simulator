# Wordle Simulator

## What is Wordle Simulator?

The Wordle Simulator is a simple project that utilizes the rules of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) to simulate a round of Wordle and generate a report. This report provides detailed information about each round, allowing for further analysis. By running the simulator multiple times, we can gather sufficient data to conduct statistical analysis and gain insights into the game mechanics.

In this document, we aim to identify and address various problems by performing analytics on the data generated by our simulator.

## How does it work?

The Wordle Simulator consists of two main functions:

1. `check`: This function takes a guess and compares it with the answer, providing feedback on the guess.

2. `guess_word`: This function, optionally utilizing the feedback from the `check` function, generates a new word as an output.

By combining these functions, the Wordle Simulator simulates the process of guessing words and evaluating their correctness based on the rules of the game.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the simulator to gain insights into Wordle mechanics and explore potential problem-solving approaches.

For more details and a deeper understanding of the insights derived from the data generated by the simulator, you can check the [Report File](https://github.com/Ali-jb/Wordle-Simulator/blob/master/Wordle%20Simulator%20Analysis%20Report.pdf).
The report provides a comprehensive analysis and findings based on the simulator's output.
